Fast Food Booking System is a Database project developed as a part of acedemic project of the course Advanced Database Management System. 
This project is developed by a group of three students ( Surya, Anwesha, Suman ) while pursuing our MTech course.
As a part of this we have used a static data and by displaying it over a simple python interface we intended to recieve the user's choice of ordering the available items.
As soon as the user adds the food items to the cart and confirms the order, the database is updated with a new order and acknowledges the user with a auto generated booking id.
