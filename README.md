Fast Food Booking System is a Database project developed as a part of the academic project of the course Advanced Database Management System. 
As a part of this, we have used static data, and by displaying it over a simple Python interface we intended to receive the user's choice of ordering the available items.
As soon as the user adds the food items to the cart and confirms the order, the database is updated with a new order and acknowledges the user with an auto-generated booking ID.
